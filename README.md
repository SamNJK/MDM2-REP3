# MDM2-REP3
This Python script simulates and visualizes the movement of walkers in a grid, tracking their health status (healthy, infected, or recovered).

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.

These scripts requires the following Python libraries, if not built in you can install these with pip:

matplotlib
numpy
scipy.stats
random

# Task 1 & Task 2

Running the Script:
No inputs are required to running the scripts. After running it will display the animation of the walkers' movement and plots of the initial and final position

Understanding the Output:
The script generates an animation showing the movement of walkers on a grid. Walkers can be in one of three states:

Healthy (blue)
Infected (red)
Recovered (green)
The animation shows the movement of the walkers at each step, with their color indicating their current health status.

# plotting_averages

This codes runs with the task 1 conditions.

Understanding the Output:
The script generates a plot showing the average number of individuals in each state (susceptible, infected, recovered) over time. This plot provides an understanding of how the infection spreads and recedes in the population.

Modifying the Simulation:
You can modify the parameters of the simulation (such as the number of individuals, the number of runs, the infection probability, the recovery probability, etc.) by changing the corresponding variables in the script.


# Task 3 - SIR Models
#SIR.py

Understanding the Output:
The script generates a plot showing the number of individuals in each state (susceptible, infected, recovered) over time. This plot provides an understanding of how the infection spreads and recedes in the population according to the SIR model.

Modifying the Simulation:
You can modify the parameters of the simulation (such as the total population, the initial number of infected individuals, the duration of the simulation, the infection rate, and the recovery rate) by changing the corresponding variables in the script.

#Stochastic_SIR.py

Understanding the Output:
The script generates a plot showing the number of individuals in each state (susceptible, infected, recovered) over time. This plot provides an understanding of how the infection spreads and recedes in the population according to the SIR model.

Modifying the Simulation:
You can modify the parameters of the simulation (such as the total population, the initial number of infected individuals, the duration of the simulation, the infection rate, and the recovery rate) by changing the corresponding variables in the script.
