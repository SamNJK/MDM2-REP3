# MDM2-REP3
# Task 1 
This Python script simulates and visualizes the movement of walkers in a grid, tracking their health status (healthy, infected, or recovered).

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.

This script requires the following Python libraries, if not built in you can install these with pip:

matplotlib
numpy
scipy.stats
random

Running the Script
No inputs are required to running the scripts. After running it will display the animation of the walkers' movement and plots of the initial and final position

Understanding the Output
The script generates an animation showing the movement of walkers on a grid. Walkers can be in one of three states:

Healthy (blue)
Infected (red)
Recovered (green)
The animation shows the movement of the walkers at each step, with their color indicating their current health status.



# I've modified a function(two_dimensional_random_walk) in it_works_code_lists_animation.py to do task2 by modifying the action strategy
